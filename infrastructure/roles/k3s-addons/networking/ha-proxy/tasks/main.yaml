      🌐 Control Plane VIP Access:
      - VIP Address: 10.0.0.10:6443

      - Local API health: {{ 'HEALTHY' if api_health_local.status == 200 else 'UNHEALTHY' }}
      - VIP API health: {{ 'HEALTHY' if api_health_vip.status == 200 else 'NOT TESTED' if vip_assigned.stdout | int == 0 else 'UNHEALTHY' }}
      
      🔧 Configuration Details:
      - Health check interval: 2 seconds (/healthz endpoint)
      - Failover TTL: 2 seconds (keepalived advert_int=1, check interval=2)
      - Authentication: VRRP with shared secret
      - Local backend: 127.0.0.1:6443
      
      🛠️ Validation & Testing:
      - Run validation: /usr/local/bin/validate-ha-control-plane
      - Test failover: sudo systemctl stop keepalived (on MASTER node)
      - Monitor VIP: watch -n 1 'ip addr | grep 10.0.0.10'
      - Update kubeconfig: kubectl config set-cluster default --server=https://10.0.0.10:6443
      
      📋 Next Steps:
      1. Run validation script on all master nodes
      2. Update K3s agent nodes to use VIP (10.0.0.10:6443)
      3. Test failover scenarios (Task 5)
      4. Monitor with observability stack (Task 10)
      
      ⚠️ Important: This creates a truly HA control plane with 2s failover!
      🔄 The VIP will automatically move between master nodes on failure.
